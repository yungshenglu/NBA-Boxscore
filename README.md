# NBA-Boxscore VSCode Extension

This repository is my first practice to implement a simple NBA boxscrore extension on Visual Studio Code (VS-Code) using TypeScript. For now, we enable users to see the live score and further detail of daily matches.

## Features

> (To be updated.)

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:
