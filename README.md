# NBA-Boxscore (VSCode Extension)

![](./src/img/demo-1.png)

You can download [here](https://github.com/yungshenglu/NBA-Boxscore/releases/tag/v0.0.1)! ðŸŽ‰

This repository is my first practice to implement a simple NBA boxscore extension on Visual Studio Code (VSCode) using TypeScript. For now, we enable users to see the live score and further detail of daily matches.

> HINT: If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.
